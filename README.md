## Description
This employee managment system will allow the user to add, view, and update information about their employees. The add function, will allow the user to add departments to that database along with the roles and their salaries that each department. The final feature that the add function allows is that the user can add new employees, with basic information like their name, along with the role they have and their managers id number. The view function is very basic and just lets the user see each database in table form. The last update feature allows to update the role of on employee. Plans for the future are to add a delete function, along with having more functionallity to the view and update parts of the project.
